"2. Data are not available for this area for all of the requested years. See Caveats below for more information."
"---"
Caveats:
"1. County geography changes over time. New counties are created and old counties are deleted or their boundaries are modified."
"The county codes and names for years 1990-1999 are based on Census 2000 geography; those for year 2000 and later are based on"
"Census 2010 geography."
"2. Hoonah-Angoon Census Area, Alaska (FIPS code 02105) was created from the former Skagway-Hoonah-Angoon Census Area (FIPS code"
"02232) effective June 20, 2007. This change was made retroactive in the data to the year 2000. Therefore population estimates"
"for Hoonah-Angoon Census Area are available for years 2000 and later."
"3. Ketchikan Gateway Borough, Alaska (FIPS code 02130) annexed most of Outer Ketchikan from the former Prince of Wales-Outer"
"Ketchikan Census Area (FIPS code 02201) effective May 19, 2008. This change was made retroactive in the data to the year 2000."
"Therefore Ketchikan Gateway Borough has a discontinuity in the population estimates between 1999 and 2000 due to the addition of"
"population."
"4. About Petersburg Borough/Census Area, Alaska (FIPS code 02195): Petersburg Census Area was formed on June 1, 2008 from part"
"of the former Wrangell-Petersburg Census Area (FIPS code 02280). Effective January 3, 2013, Petersburg Census Area ceased to"
"exist; Petersburg Borough (same FIPS code 02195) was formed from part of Petersburg Census Area and part of Hoonah-Angoon Census"
"Area (02105). Population estimates for Petersburg Census Area are shown for years 2000-2009. Population estimates for Petersburg"
"Borough are shown for years after 2010."
"5. Prince of Wales-Hyder Census Area, Alaska (FIPS code 02198) was formed on June 1, 2008 from part of the former Prince of"
"Wales-Outer Ketchikan Census Area (FIPS code 02201). This change was made retroactive in the data to the year 2000. Therefore"
"population estimates for Prince of Wales-Hyder Census Area are available for years 2000 and later."
"6. Prince of Wales-Outer Ketchikan Census Area, Alaska (FIPS code 02201) ceased to exist effective June 1, 2008. The Outer"
"Ketchikan area was annexed by the Ketchikan Gateway Borough (FIPS code 02130), part was included in Wrangell City and Borough"
"(FIPS code 02275), and the remainder was renamed Prince of Wales-Hyder Census Area (FIPS code 02198). This change was made"
"retroactive in the data to the year 2000. Therefore population estimates for Prince of Wales-Outer Ketchikan Census Area are"
"only available for the years 1990-1999."
"7. Skagway Municipality, Alaska (FIPS code 02230) was created from the former Skagway-Hoonah-Angoon Census Area (FIPS code"
"02232) effective June 20, 2007. This change was made retroactive in the data to the year 2000. Therefore population estimates"
"for Skagway Municipality are available for years 2000 and later."
"8. Skagway-Hoonah-Angoon Census Area, Alaska (FIPS code 02232) ceased to exist effective June 20, 2007. Skagway Municipality"
"(FIPS code 02230) and Hoonah-Angoon Census Area (FIPS code 02105) were created from the former census area. This change was made"
"retroactive in the data to the year 2000. Therefore population estimates for Skagway-Hoonah-Angoon Census Area are only"
